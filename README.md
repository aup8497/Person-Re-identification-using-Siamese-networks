# Person-Re-identification-using-Siamese-networks

## About 
This is done as a part of Information Retrieval Course project.

This is a Keras implementation of **[Person re-identification with deep features and transfer learning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8005887/)**. Basically it is a transfer learning model which fine tunes VGG16 network.

There are 2 implementations here.
* Usual transfer learning model using VGG16 architecture.
* Simple Siamese network model. 

The dataset used here is CUHK01. The dataset can be obtained [here](http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~xgwang/CUHK_identification.html) .

## Python Dependencies

* Numpy
* Keras
* OpenCV (cv2)
